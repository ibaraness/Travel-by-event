# Travel by event
A small module that shows future events and concerts.

## The Problem
Lots of people are looking for concerts abroad - and want schedule their vacation dates accordingly

## The Goal
The goal of this module is to notify users for incoming events and concerts, so that they won't have to leave the site and look for it somewhere else. 

You can check the demo [here](http://ibaraness.com/demos/booking/events/)

## Demo
Currently the module demo is using fake static data, but it's data that I've fetched from Eventful API, and I can easily turn it to live data.
The 'Find accomodation' button is not doing anything right now, but we can use it to fetch close by accomodations in the future, using the location data of the event.

## Desired results
The idea is that users could find concerts and book for accomodation ahead.

## Dependencies
The current implementation depend on:
- jQuery(version 3.2.1, but even older versions will work)
- Underscore(_)
